# Java-DBMS

This repository about two different Java database management systems. Both of them were done as homeworks for my database class. The first one, foodrecdb,
connects to a remote database and provides an easy to use Java interface for various operations such as creating tables, adding elements, and more advanced queries. <br>
The second one, cengify, is an implementation of two B+ trees for optimized database indexing. This one has an interactive GUI with which we can insert and search elements, 
and print the entire tree. It can be run using the following parameters: <br>
`[order (3 is ideal)] [GUI option] [input path]` <br>
With the following GUI options: <br>
- 0: No GUI <br>
- 1: Only primary tree <br>
- 2: Only secondary tree <br>
- 3: Both trees
